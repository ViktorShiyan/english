I am Viktor. I live in Omsk. Now I will tell you about my day. I get up at 8.00 o`clock and I go to wash.
I usually cook eggs for breakfast. After breakfast, I go to play a guitar. I like to play my fancy guitar.
Next, I learn English and I do exercise. I begin to work at 12.00. I write microservices on Java language.
In my work use modern technologies. I work with apache Kafka and PostgresQl. After work, I often drink beer.
