Hi. My name is Viktor. I am 31. I`m from Russia, from Omsk. I have a wife and a son.

After graduating from high school,I entered the Omsk Flight Technical College of Civil Aviation.
After graduating from the college, I got a job at an airport in Talakan, in Yakutia.
How long did I work in aviation? I worked in the airport for 7 years.
While I worked as aviation engineer, I studied in Omsk Technical University as a software developer.
After graduating the university, I got a bachelor in IT.

In 2020 I left the airport, because COVID began and the crisis in aviation started.
Since that time I have been working as professional java developer. I have experience in financial systems. I have been
developing enterprise level microservises.
My favorite technology for work, spring boot, relation data base postgresql, message brokker KAFKA. I have experience
working with jira,confluens,team city.
My team is currently developing directory for sale points.
